### Project Description
Face-to-Fruit is a comic-themed web app that hilariously matches your selfie to a fruit or veggie and roasts you with a savage, personalized caption.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Not enough people know which vegetable or fruit they spiritually resemble. The world lacks official roast certificates from produce.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A face detection-powered web app that assigns you your "spirit produce" and roasts you based on your face's vibe. Download and share your Roast Certificate for ultimate bragging/shaming rights!
